## Point Estimation Project
(wip) just for now if you are interested, here's some info <br>
- for the input, you have to follow the order below
    > [ d1, d2, d3, ..., dn]/seperation_count 

    so the idea is that you pass in the data (d) values as you wish, then use a "/" for defining the seperation_count (the count of indexes picked)

- click "try" to see magic :)
- you can also generate random data to test and all, if you are lazy @_@
- click on the "poles" (chart values) to get teleported to the indexes considered with that average... wooooh, more magic ^-^ lol
- at last, enjoy! and feel free to give suggestions, and let me know if I missed anything <3 love you all
